Assignment 1

For my visualization of the 1900 and 2000 Census data, I chose to answer the question, "How did the United States population change between the 1900 and 2000 Census as a function of age and gender?".  To answer this question, I designed my visualization to consider both how the total male and female population varied as a function of age between the 1900 and 2000 Census data and how the male and female populations varied relative to each other.  My visualization should capture change, both relative and absolute, between the male and female populations and two census years.  The goal of my data visualization was to clearly display the major population differences between the 1900 and 2000 Census in order to motivate the reader to ask why these changes occurred, e.g. why are there more females than males in this age range?   I chose two chart types to accomplish these goals: a stacked bar chart and a line chart with data points.

To show how the total male and female population changes as a function of time and age bin, I produced a vertical stacked bar chart (top panel) where for each age bin, I plotted a bar for the 1900 and 2000 census that had the female population stacked on top of the male population.  I scaled the population to be in units of millions of people as this is a familiar unit of measure for the population of a nation, e.g. the United States has a population of around 350 million people. I colored the male and female bars blue and pink, respectively, as these colors are commonly used for each sex.  The stacked bar chart shows how both sexes' populations change and how those changes contribute to the total population in each age bin.  This choice allows for an easy discrimination of how the United States' population as a function of age changed from the 1900 to 2000 Census.  For example in the 40-50 age bins, the 2000 Census data bars demonstrate that not only has the total population increased, but especially so in those age bins due to the "Baby Boom" in the mid-1940s to 1960s, causing the population distribution to have a noticeable peak. To clearly differentiate the two census years, I used solid-color bars for the 1900 Census data and the same colored bars for the 2000 Census data, but with a black diagonal hatch and.  I included a legend in the upper-righthand corner of the figure to help the reader differentiate between the two datasets.  Having the 1900 and 2000 Census stacked bars next to each other in each age bin allows the reader to clearly see not only how much the total population in each age bin increased from 1900 to 2000, but also how the total population distribution changed.

To complement the stacked bar chart, I included a subplot below that plots the male-female ratio as a function of age for each census.  I set the two subplots to share the same x-axis, age, since both subplots use the same x-axis values and to eliminate unnecessary x-axis labels for the top subplot that would have cluttered the figure.  This subplot complements the stacked bar chart by clearly displaying, as a ratio, how many more males there are then females, or vice-versa, in each age bin.  This provides a scale for the reader for easier interpretation of the stacked bar chart and also highlights interesting features of the population distribution that is harder to tease out of the bar chart.  For example, the male-female ratio plot shows that about around 70 years old, there are many more females than males.  To highlight these differences, I included a black-dashed line at 1, the point where the number of males and females is equal for a given age bin, and colored the line by the more populous sex, e.g. blue if the curve is above 1, and pink below.  I used two different markers, filled circles and squares, to distinguish the two census datasets.

A limitation of my design is that I did not clearly convey to the viewer that the census data is binned. For example, for the 0-4 years old bin, I just plotted the data at x = 0 and labeled that point as 0 years old.  I chose to not display the binned nature of the data as it is sufficiently discretized into 5 year age bins that saying all 0-4 years olds are in the 0 bin is approximately correct and still allows me to show population-level changes, my stated goal.
