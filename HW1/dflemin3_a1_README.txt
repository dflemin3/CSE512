Assignment 1

For my visualization of the 1900 and 2000 Census data, I chose to answer the question, "How did the United States population change between the 1900 and 2000 Census as a function of age and gender?".  To answer this question, I designed my visualization to display both how much the population grew between the 1900 and 2000 Census data and how this growth depended on sex and age.  My visualization should capture change, both relative and absolute, between the male and female populations and two census years as a function of age and it should be readily interpretable for a general audience. I chose two visual encodings to accomplish these goals: a stacked bar chart and a line plot with data points.

To show how the total population changes as a function of time, age, and sex, I produced a vertical stacked bar chart (top panel) where for each age bin, I plotted a bar for the 1900 and 2000 census that had the female population stacked on top of the male population.  The stacked bar chart encoding effectively displays how both sexes' populations change and how those changes contribute to the total population in each age bin.  I scaled the population to be in units of millions of people as this is a familiar unit of measure for the population of a nation, e.g. the United States has a population of around 350 million people. I colored the male and female bars blue and pink, respectively, as these colors are the stereotypical color used for each sex.  I noted this color choice in the legend for additional clarity. The stacked bar chart allows for an easy discrimination of how the United States' population, as a function of age and sex, changed from the 1900 to 2000 Census.  For example in the 40-50 age bins, the 2000 Census data bars demonstrate that not only has the total population increased, but especially so in those age bins due to the "Baby Boom" in the mid-1940s to 1960s, causing the population distribution to have a noticeable peak. To differentiate the two census years, I used solid-color bars for the 1900 Census data and the same colored bars for the 2000 Census data, but with a black diagonal hatch.  I included a legend in the upper-righthand corner of the figure to help the reader differentiate between the two datasets.  Having the 1900 and 2000 Census stacked bars next to each other in each age bin allows the reader to clearly see not only how much the total population in each age bin increased from 1900 to 2000, but also how the total population distribution changed.

To complement the stacked bar chart, I included a subplot (bottom panel) below that plots the male-female ratio as a function of age for each census as a line plot with symbols at the location of each datapoint.  A line plot is an effective encoding for this data as its a simple way to display how the male-female ratio changes over time. I set the two subplots to share the same x-axis, age, since both subplots use the same quantitative x-axis values and to eliminate unnecessary x-axis labels for the top subplot that would have cluttered up the figure.  This subplot complements the stacked bar chart by clearly displaying, as a ratio, how many more males there are then females, or vice-versa, in each age bin.  This provides an additional reference for the reader for easier interpretation of the stacked bar chart and also highlights interesting features of the population distribution that is harder to tease out of the stacked bar chart.  For example, the male-female ratio plot shows that about around 70 years old and older, there are many more females than males.  To highlight these differences, I included a black-dashed line at 1, the point where the number of males and females is equal for a given age bin, and colored the ratio lines by the more populous sex, e.g. blue if the given census' curve is above 1, and pink below.  I used two different markers, filled circles and squares, to distinguish between the two census datasets and noted this choice in a legend.

A limitation of my design is that I did not clearly convey to the viewer that the census data is binned. For example, for the 0-4 years old bin, I just plotted the data at x = 0 and labeled that point as 0 years old.  I chose to not display the binned nature of the data as it is sufficiently discretized into 5 year age bins that saying all 0-4 years olds are in the 0 bin is approximately correct and still allows me to show population-level changes, my stated goal.
